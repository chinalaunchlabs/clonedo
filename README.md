# Clone-Do
Yet another todo list manager app.

## Notes
* Shameless clone of the Xamarin Todo project ([link](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/Todo)).
* Uses shared project to implement SQLite access (see [this](http://github.com/chinalaunchlabs/reference-sqlite) for more information).

## To Do
* Re-implement using PCL?
* Add due date (DatePicker).
* Group tasks (Done, Not done - sorted in descending order)
* UI issues
	* Try to do the floating "+" interface for new tasks that's part of Android's Material design?
* Remove the damn title icon.
